# Disease-Detection-using-Image-Recognition


## Objective:

To diagnose Covid-19 and Viral Pneumonia in patients using chest X-Ray images 

## Dataset:

•	Contains separate folders of training and testing data
•	The train data consists of X-Ray images of Covid-19 and Viral Pneumonia diagnosed patients along with images of healthy patients
•	The test data is also distinguished similar to the train dataset

## Algorithms used:
• VGG 16 model
• ResNet model
• DenseNet model

## Model Accuracy:
VGG-16 model: 51%
ResNet model: 74.24%
DenseNet model: 59.5%

## Champion Model
We can conclude that our champion model is ResNet model with a model accuracy of 74.2%

## Result
Using the ResNet model, we can classify the X-ray images between Covid-19 and Viral Pneumonia, and also separate them from patients who do not have any disease.
